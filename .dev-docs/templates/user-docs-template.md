## 3. Key Features

_A concise overview of the main functionalities, focusing on user benefits and how to access them._

### Convert Single Files

- **What it does**: Change one file from its current format to a new one.
- **How to use**:
  ```bash
  file-converter convert <INPUT_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE> --from <SOURCE_FORMAT> --to <TARGET_FORMAT>
  ```
  - `<INPUT_FILE>`: The path to the file you want to convert.
  - `<OUTPUT_FILE>`: The path where you want the new, converted file to be saved.
  - `<SOURCE_FORMAT>`: The current format of your input file (e.g., `jpg`, `pdf`, `mp3`).
  - `<TARGET_FORMAT>`: The format you want to convert your file to (e.g., `png`, `txt`, `wav`).
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  file-converter convert document.pdf report.txt --from pdf --to txt
  ```
  > This converts `document.pdf` into a plain text file named `report.txt`.

### Convert Multiple Files (Batch Conversion)

- **What it does**: Convert all files of a specific type within a folder at once.
- **How to use**:
  ```bash
  file-converter batch-convert <INPUT_FOLDER> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> --from <SOURCE_FORMAT> --to <TARGET_FORMAT> [--recursive]
  ```
  - `<INPUT_FOLDER>`: The folder containing the files you want to convert.
  - `<OUTPUT_FOLDER>`: The folder where the converted files will be saved.
  - `--recursive` (Optional): Add this flag if you want to convert files in subfolders too.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  file-converter batch-convert ./my_images ./converted_images --from jpg --to webp --recursive
  ```
  > This converts all JPGs in `my_images` and its subfolders to WebP, saving them in `converted_images`.
