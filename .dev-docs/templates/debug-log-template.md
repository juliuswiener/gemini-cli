## 1. Issue Description & Reproduction Steps

_This section details the problem as initially reported and the precise steps to reliably reproduce it._

### Original Issue

[Concise summary of the bug/unexpected behavior.]

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  [Step 1]
2.  [Step 2]
3.  [Step 3]

### Expected Outcome

[What should have happened.]

### Actual Outcome

[What actually happened, including error messages, console output, etc.]

## 2. Diagnostic Process & Findings

_This section documents the methodical approach taken to isolate the root cause, including attempts made and their results._

### Diagnostic Attempts & Results

- **Attempt 1**: [Brief description of what was tried, e.g., "Ran the conversion with a smaller input file."]
  - **Result**: [Outcome, e.g., "Issue still reproducible, indicating problem is not related to file size."]

- **Attempt 2**: [Brief description of what was tried, e.g., "Inspected application logs for module src/core_converter."]
  - **Result**: [Outcome, e.g., "Found ValueError originating from image_processor.py when target_format was 'webp'."]

- **Attempt 3**: [Brief description of what was tried, e.g., "Stepped through _convert_image_pillow() in debugger with problematic input."]
  - **Result**: [Outcome, e.g., "Identified that Pillow's save() method was called with an incorrect quality parameter for WebP, leading to corruption."]

_... (Add more attempts and results as necessary to show the investigative path.)_

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

_This section provides a clear, unequivocal statement of the underlying cause of the bug._

- **Identified Root Cause**: [e.g., "The _convert_image_pillow function was passing a quality parameter (intended for JPG) directly to Pillow's save() method for WebP, which expects a method parameter instead, leading to an invalid argument and file corruption."]
- **Scope of Impact**: [e.g., "Affects all WebP conversions. Does not impact JPG or PNG conversions. May lead to corrupted output files for users attempting WebP conversion."]

---

## 4. Proposed Fix

_This section outlines the minimal, clean solution to address the identified root cause._

### Proposed Solution

- **Description**: [e.g., "Modify _convert_image_pillow to check the target_format. If target_format is 'webp', pass a method parameter (e.g., method=6 for highest quality) instead of quality to Pillow's save() method. Remove the quality parameter for WebP conversions."]
- **Affected Files/Lines**: `src/core_converter/image_converter.py` (lines 120-125)
- **Dependencies for Fix**: None.

### Code Snippet (Illustrative)

```python
# Before
# img.save(output_path, quality=90)

# After
if target_format == 'webp':
    img.save(output_path, method=6) # Use 'method' for WebP
else:
    img.save(output_path, quality=90) # Use 'quality' for other formats like JPG
```

## 5. Verification Plan

_This section details how the fix will be verified post-implementation._

- [ ] Re-run original steps to reproduce (see section 1).
- [ ] Verify that the `.webp` output file is valid and opens correctly.
- [ ] Run all relevant unit tests for `core_converter`.
- [ ] Run integration tests involving WebP conversion.
