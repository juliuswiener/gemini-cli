# User Story: Basic User-Directed Concurrent Calls

- **ID**: US-001
- **Status**: Validated
- **Created By**: Storyteller Mode

---

## 1. Description _(Core User Need)_

**As a** `Gemini CLI User`,
**I want to** explicitly specify multiple independent prompts in a single command using `callN: prompt` syntax,
**so that** I can receive parallel analyses or responses for distinct queries more quickly.

---

## 2. Acceptance Criteria _(Definition of "Done" for this Story)_

This section defines the measurable conditions that must be met for this user story to be considered complete and successful from the user's perspective. Each criterion should be testable.

### Scenario: Successful Concurrent Execution

- **Given** the user provides a valid command with `callN: prompt` syntax (e.g., `gemini -p "call1: prompt1, call2: prompt2"`)
- **When** the command is executed
- **Then** the system parses the input into distinct concurrent calls
- **And** multiple API requests are initiated in parallel
- **And** a single, aggregated stream of responses is returned to the user

### Scenario: Malformed Syntax Handling

- **Given** the user provides malformed `callN: prompt` syntax
- **When** the command is executed
- **Then** the system gracefully falls back to sequential processing or provides a clear error/warning
- **And** no unexpected behavior or crashes occur

# User Story: Intelligent Prompt Processing

- **ID**: US-002
- **Status**: Validated
- **Created By**: Storyteller Mode

---

## 1. Description _(Core User Need)_

**As a** `Gemini CLI User`,
**I want to** the CLI to automatically determine if my prompt would benefit from concurrent or sequential processing,
**so that** I get the most efficient and comprehensive response without manual intervention.

---

## 2. Acceptance Criteria _(Definition of "Done" for this Story)_

This section defines the measurable conditions that must be met for this user story to be considered complete and successful from the user's perspective. Each criterion should be testable.

### Scenario: Automatic Concurrent Processing

- **Given** the user provides a complex prompt suitable for multi-perspective analysis (e.g., "Analyze this code for security and performance")
- **When** the command is executed without explicit force flags or syntax
- **Then** the system uses LLM analysis to identify concurrent opportunities
- **And** the prompt is broken down into multiple concurrent calls
- **And** the aggregated response reflects the parallel analyses

### Scenario: Automatic Sequential Processing

- **Given** the user provides a straightforward prompt best suited for a single, direct answer (e.g., "What is TypeScript?")
- **When** the command is executed without explicit force flags or syntax
- **Then** the system uses LLM analysis to determine sequential processing is optimal
- **And** a single, direct response is provided without concurrent calls

### Scenario: LLM Analysis Failure Fallback

- **Given** the LLM analysis fails or returns a malformed response
- **When** the command is executed
- **Then** the system gracefully falls back to manual syntax parsing (if applicable) or standard sequential processing
- **And** the user still receives a response, even if not optimally processed

**so that** I can override automatic decisions for specific use cases or testing.

---

## 2. Acceptance Criteria _(Definition of "Done" for this Story)_

This section defines the measurable conditions that must be met for this user story to be considered complete and successful from the user's perspective. Each criterion should be testable.

### Scenario: Force Sequential via CLI Flag

- **Given** the user executes a command with `--force-sequential` flag
- **When** the command is executed
- **Then** the system processes the prompt sequentially, regardless of its content or LLM analysis
- **And** the response is a single, coherent output

### Scenario: Force Concurrent via Prompt Prefix

- **Given** the user executes a command with `[CONCURRENT]` prefix in the prompt
- **When** the command is executed
- **Then** the system processes the prompt concurrently, attempting to split it into parallel calls
- **And** the response is an aggregated stream from multiple calls

### Scenario: Force Processing via Environment Variable

- **Given** `GEMINI_FORCE_PROCESSING` environment variable is set to `sequential` or `concurrent`
- **When** the command is executed without CLI flags or prompt prefixes
- **Then** the system adheres to the processing mode specified by the environment variable
- **And** CLI flags and prompt prefixes take precedence over environment variables

---

## 2. Acceptance Criteria _(Definition of "Done" for this Story)_

This section defines the measurable conditions that must be met for this user story to be considered complete and successful from the user's perspective. Each criterion should be testable.

### Scenario: Streaming Aggregation

- **Given** multiple concurrent API calls are executing
- **When** events (content, tool calls, etc.) are received from individual streams
- **Then** the `StreamAggregator` merges these events into a single output stream
- **And** events are attributed to their respective `callId` (e.g., `call1`, `call2`)
- **And** the output is presented in a readable, organized format (e.g., with section headers)

### Scenario: Real-time Delivery

- **Given** a concurrent command is running
- **When** partial results or events become available from any parallel call
- **Then** these events are yielded to the user immediately, without buffering until all calls complete
- **And** the user perceives a continuous flow of information

### Scenario: Error Handling in Streams

- **Given** one or more concurrent streams encounter an error (e.g., API failure, timeout)
- **When** the error occurs
- **Then** the `StreamAggregator` handles the error gracefully for that specific stream
- **And** other active streams continue to process and yield results
- **And** the aggregated output includes an indication of the failed stream, without crashing the entire process
